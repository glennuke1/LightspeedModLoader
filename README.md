# Lightspeed Mod Loader

Lightspeed Mod Loader (or LML) is a new mod loader for My Winter Car

LML is built with optimizations and compatability in mind for low end hardware users

Note: LML is an early beta currently made for personal use (because i like using my own stuff so i can modify it to my needs), but feel free to use it if you'd like

# Installation

1. Download and run the [installer](https://github.com/glennuke1/LightspeedModLoader/raw/refs/heads/master/LML_Installer/LML_Installer.exe)
2. Select your MWC Executable file
3. Click install

# MSCLoader compatability

LML is compatible with most, if not all MSCLoader mods and is constantly improving in compatability and performance

LML comes installed with a modified version of MSCLoader.dll for loading MSCLoader mods and redirecting methods called by mods to LML

As of now MSCLoader mods' settings need to be modified through their respective files e.g. mods/Config/somemscloadermod/settings.json

If you can't figure out how to do that, you can either stop using LML and/or wait for an update

# Is LML a virus?

LML is FOSS (Free open source software)

It is written in C#, which means you can freely decompile it and look at all of the code (including the official mods and the installer)

Even though the mod loader source code is available on github, you can still look through the code of the installer and official mods using [DnSpy](https://github.com/dnSpy/dnSpy)
