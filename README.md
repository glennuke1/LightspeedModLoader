# Lightspeed Mod Loader

Lightspeed Mod Loader (or LML) is a new mod loader for My Summer Car built from scratch

LML is built with optimizations and compatability in mind for low end hardware users

LML is ***NOT*** a fork of MSCLoader, unlike Mod Loader Pro

# Installation

1. Download and run the installer
2. Select your MSC Executable file
3. Click install

There is an option to install official mods such as the console and mod list menu, although these are not required to use LML by itself, some mods will still require them. This option is on by default

# MSCLoader compatability

LML is compatible with most, if not all MSCLoader mods and is constantly improving in compatability and performance

LML comes installed with a modified version of MSCLoader.dll for loading MSCLoader mods and redirecting methods called by mods to LML

As of now MSCLoader mods' settings need to be modified through their respective files e.g. mods/Config/somemscloadermod/settings.json

If you can't figure out how to do that, you can either stop using LML and/or wait for an update

# Mod Loader Pro compatability

Mod Loader Pro is abandoned and mods made for it are ***NOT*** supported by LML

Users using Mod Loader Pro will not recieve any support
